# Analysis-of-Watts-Strogatz-model-and-a-calculation-on-properties-of-various-networks

This repo includes six R scripts.
1. simulation1.R is the script to verify the core statement of Watts-Strogatz-model, which suggests that the onset of “small-world” phenomenon can be observed by adding randomness to a regular sparse graph, while the transition to the “small-world” is almost undetectable in a local level.

2. sparsity_pathlength.R is the script to explore the effect of graph density on characteristic path length.

3. sparsity_cluster.R is the script to explore the effect of graph density on clustering coefficient.

4. facebook_network.R and US_airport_network.R are scripts calculating the characteristic path length and clustering coefficient of the original network and the corresponding regular network and random network.
